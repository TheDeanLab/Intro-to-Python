    "In many cases, you will find the need to interpret and present tabular results. Often this requires some way to visualize potential patterns in the data. A great library to do this is `seaborn` because:\n",
    "1) it has access to excellent colormaps which mimick the role of RColorBrewer in R, and has functions to plot the color palette. You can also customize with respect to e.g. saturation \n",
    "2) we can plot some complex plots that would require extra computation, panelling and layout in `matplotlib` to achieve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** I do want to emphasize, getting things especially fonts to look exactly right programmatically is not necessary and you don't need to panel either because we can save any plots to vector graphics and compose/change any element using external programs e.g. Adobe illustrator, Affinity Designer.\n",

    "For these exercises, we will just use the standard datasets available in `seaborn`, as they give us a bit more to play with. \n",
