# Creating a Python Environment
Why do we need environments?

** **

<v-clicks>

- Imagine you‚Äôre working on two projects:
  - One needs **Python 3.10** and **NumPy 1.20**
  - Another needs **Python 3.12** and **NumPy 2.0**
- If everything installs in the same place‚Ä¶ üß® they **clash**!
- Your computer won‚Äôt know which version to use.

# Creating a Python Environment
What is an environment?

** **

<v-clicks>

- An **environment** is like a **mini workspace** inside your computer.
- Each environment has its **own Python** and its **own packages**.
- You can switch between them anytime ‚Äî like having multiple ‚Äútoolboxes‚Äù.

- Keep different projects **separate**

# Creating a Python Environment
Steps to create a basic environment

** **


- Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following

<v-click>
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.12 -y
```
</v-click>


- Then activate you environment:

<v-click>
```bash
conda activate myenv
```
</v-click>

<v-click>
‚úÖ Now you have a clean space with just Python installed!
You can add packages later (e.g., conda install numpy).
