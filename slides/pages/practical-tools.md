# Practical Tools for Running Python Software

**Command Line Execution** 

Using `python script.py` or running the Python interpreter directly from the terminal.

- **Step 1: Open the Command Line.**
    - Windows: Open Command Prompt (search for `cmd`or `Command Prompt`).
    - macOS/Linux: Open Terminal.

- **Step 2: Navigate to your Working Directory.** 

    Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you want to create and execute your Python script. 
    ```
    cd path/to/your/folder
    ```

    ```
    # hello.py
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

- **Step 4: Execute the Python Script.**  

    Run the script using the following command:
    ```

**Interactive Mode**

Entering the Python interpreter by typing `python` in the terminal and running code line-by-line interactively.

- **Step 1: Open the Command Line.**
    - Windows: Open Command Prompt (search for `cmd` or `Command Prompt`).
    - macOS/Linux: Open Terminal.

- **Step 2: Start the Python Interpreter.**  

    Enter the following command to start the interactive mode:
    ```
    python
    ```

    - Once in the interactive mode, your terminal will output information on the `Python` installation.
        ```

**Interactive Mode**

Entering the Python interpreter by typing `python` in the terminal and running code line-by-line interactively.


- **Step 3: Test a Simple Python Command.** 

    Once the interpreter starts, you can run Python code line-by-line. For example:
    ```
    >>> print("Hello, World!")
    ```

- **Step 4: Define a Simple Variable and Perform a Calculation.**  

    Enter commands directly into the interpreter:
    ```
    >>> x = 5
    >>> y = 10
    >>> result = x + y
    >>> print(result)
    ```

- **Step 5: Exit the Python Interpreter.**

    To exit the interactive mode, type:
    ```
    >>> exit()
    ```

**Interactive Mode**

  - **Advantages:**
    - Immediate feedback; great for testing small snippets of code.
    - Excellent for learning and experimentation.
    - No need to save or create files for quick code execution.
  - **Disadvantages:**
    - Not ideal for running large programs.
    - Requires manually saving work if you want to retain results.
    - Code can't easily be reused across different projects.

**JupyterLab Notebooks**

A web-based interactive development environment for writing and executing Python code.

- **Step 1: If necessasry, install JupyterLab with pip.**
    ```
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

- **Step 2: Launch JupyterLab.**  

    Open the command line and run the following command to start JupyterLab:
    ```
    jupyter-lab
    ```
    - JupyterLab will launch in the present working directory of your terminal.

- **Step 3: Create a New Notebook.**  

    Once JupyterLab is open in your browser, click on the "Python 3" option under the "Notebook" section to create a new Python notebook.

**JupyterLab Notebooks**

- **Step 4: Run Code in Cells.** 

    In a Jupyter notebook, code is written in cells. Type the following in the first cell:
    ```
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
    - To execute the code, press `Shift + Enter` or click the "Run" button.

- **Step 5: Use Markdown for Documentation.**  

    You can also create markdown cells for documentation. Switch a cell to markdown mode by selecting ***Markdown*** from the dropdown and typing text for documentation.

## One more thing...

# Understanding `if __name__ == "__main__"`

- **What is `__name__`?**
  - In Python, `__name__` is a special built-in variable that represents the name of the current module.
  - When a Python file is run directly, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`. However, when a file is imported as a module, `__name__` is set to the module's name instead.

- **Why use `if __name__ == "__main__":`?**
  - This statement ensures that a block of code is only executed when the script is run directly, not when itâ€™s imported as a module in another script.
  - It is commonly used to encapsulate the "entry point" of a Python script.

---

# Understanding `if __name__ == "__main__"`

- **Example:**
    ```python
    # myscript.py
    def main():
        print(5+5)
        
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

- **Behavior:**
  - **When run directly:** The `main()` function will execute.
  - **When imported by another file:** The `main()` function will not automatically execute. 


**Key Benefit:** 
- It allows for reusable code by preventing specific parts of a script from running when the script is imported as a module elsewhere.
